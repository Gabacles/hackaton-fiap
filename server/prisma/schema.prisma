// Prisma schema defining the database models for the EduShare platform.
// This schema uses PostgreSQL as the data source. It defines a User model
// with two roles (TEACHER and STUDENT), an Activity model to hold quizzes
// created by teachers, a Question model for individual quiz questions, and
// a Resource model for sharing links or documents. Fields are kept minimal
// for the MVP but can be extended for additional functionality.
